# catanIA 🎲🏞️🧑‍🤝‍🧑
This project is a Python implementation of the popular board game [The Settlers of Catan](https://www.catan.com/). The goal is not only to create a version of the game that can be run in the terminal of any computer, but also to create an environment where artificial intelligence models can be developed to learn how to play Catan.

At the moment, to play the basic game, you need to execute the following command:

``python Game.py`` 

I've used the repository of the author [skleung](https://github.com/skleung/cs221) as a foundation for the initial development of the game. While I've utilized their classes and the majority of their methods, I've also introduced my own interpretation of the board and simplified the graphic design.
