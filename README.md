# catanIA
This project is a Python implementation of the popular board game [The Settlers of Catan](https://www.catan.com/). The goal is not only to create a version of the game that can be run in the terminal of any computer, but also to create an environment where artificial intelligence models can be developed to learn how to play Catan.

At the moment, to play the basic game, you need to execute the following command:

``python Game.py``
